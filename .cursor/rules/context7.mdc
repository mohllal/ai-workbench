# Use `context7` for Documentation and Examples

This rule ensures the `context7` tool is always used to retrieve the most up-to-date version-specific documentation and code examples for our tools, preventing the use of outdated information

- Trigger Condition: Use this rule whenever the user asks for documentation, setup instructions, or usage examples for **any specific tool, library, framework, or API**

- Required Tool: When the trigger condition is met, you **must** use the `context7` tool to gather fresh context *before* generating a response

- Example Scenario:
  - User Asks: "Implement basic authentication with supabase"
  - Your Action:
    1. Recognize the request relates to a specific tool (`supabase`)
    2. Automatically use `context7` to fetch its most up-to-date documentation
    3. Formulate the answer based *only* on the fresh context provided by `context7`
